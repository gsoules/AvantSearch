<div style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:12px;">Keyword Search</div>
<ul style="margin-top:-6px;">
    <li><b>All words</b><br>All of the keywords must be present in the item. The keyword <span>water</span> matches "water" and "waterfall" but not "seawater".</li>
    <li><b>Contains</b><br>The keyword or phrase must be contained in the item. A search for <span>water</span> finds "seawater", "water" and "waterfall".</li>
    <li><b>Boolean</b><br>Allows use of these keyword operators: <span>+</span>, <span>-</span>, <span>*</span>, <span>""</span> and <span>()</span>.</li>
    <ul>
        <li><span>apple banana</span> finds items that contain either or both words.</li>
        <li><span>+apple +juice</span> finds items that contain both words.</li>
        <li><span>+apple -macintosh</span> finds items that contain “apple” but not “macintosh”.</li>
        <li><span>apple*</span> finds items that contain words such as “apple”, “apples”, “applesauce”, or “applet”.</li>
        <li><span>"some words"</span> finds items that contain the exact phrase “some words” (for example, “some words of wisdom” but not “some choice words”).</li>
        <li><span>+apple +(pie juice)</span> finds items that contain “apple” and “pie”, or “apple” and “juice”.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Notes on relevancy searches</b><br>Search results will be returned in order from most to least relevant,
    but only for keyword searches on 'All fields' with the 'All words' or 'Boolean' condition. Relevancy searching is
    not supported for 'Titles only', the 'Contains' condition, or when searching by fields, year range, or tags.
    <br><br>The ranking of results is based on the following from highest to lowest:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The keywords appear in the Title field <i>and</i> the item's type is 'Reference'</li>
        <li>The keywords appear in the Title field.</li>
        <li>The item's type is 'Reference'</li>
        <li>The keywords appear in the Description field</li>
        <li>The keywords appear in other fields, but not in the Title or Description</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<div style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:12px;">Fields Search</div>
<ul style="margin-top:-6px;">
    <li><b>Matches</b><br>Use the matches options to utilize MySQL regular expression features.</li>
    <ul>
        <li><span>|</span> separates multiple search terms. <span>apple|peach|pear</span> finds items where the field contains any or all of the terms.</li>
        <li><span>[[:<:]]</span> matches the beginning of words.<span>[[:<:]]land</span> finds "land", "lands", and "landing", but not "england" or "island".</li>
        <li><span>[[:>:]]</span> matches the ending of words.<span>land[[:>:]]</span> finds "england", "island", and "land", but not "lands" or "landing".</li>
    </ul>
    <li>You can combine options to further narrow results. For example Title does not match <span>[[:<:]]land</span> AND Title matches <span>land[[:>:]]</span> to find only items where the Title contains words that end with, but don't start with "land".</li>
</ul>
<div style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:12px;">Years</div>
<ul style="margin-top:-6px;">
    <li>For an open-ended year range such as <i>from</i> 1900 or <i>until</i> 1970, leave either Start or End blank.
    Items that use a year range as their Date, for example "1861-1865," will only be searched based on the first year in the range.
    Thus, a search for items in the range 1864 to 1865 will not find the example item.</li>
</ul>
<div style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:12px;">Tags</div>
<ul style="margin-top:-6px;">
    <li>Specify a single tag to find all items having that tag. Use commas to separate tags to find items that have all of those tags.</li>
</ul>
